My excercise two doesnt really look much like the oroginal site, so I went and started trying to line by line do what they did on their site, but it has taken up too much time and I need to move on. 

I just wanted to be clear that I copied some lines directly from their css file to try to experiment with it, changing some things to match my html file.
