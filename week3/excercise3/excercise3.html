              <p class="clear">My name is Curtis Lewis, I am a software engineer with an
                interest in a wide range of developer roles. I have
                a particular focus on machine learning, but I am happy in
                almost any capacity where I am tasked with solving problems.
                I am currently a student at
                Portland State University, where I am expected to
                graduate this Spring (2020).

                In my free time I enjoy gardening, especially growing fresh produce to cook with. I also
                spend a lot of my free time trying to learn new things, sometimes for my chosen profession to
                keep myself sharp, and sometimes in an effort to learn outside of my field and broaden my
                understanding of the world around me.

            <h3>My Cat - Bella</h3>
            <p>
              When I have time to relax at home, I often take my cat Bella outside to play and explore. She is a sweet Tuxedo
              cat that
              I adopted in 2018. She is 4 years old, (as of Oct 2019), and has had a hard life, which is why I spoil her. She
              was abused
              in her first home where she lived for almost three years, but now she is coming out of her shell and has love for
              anyone
              patient enough to earn it! If you want to help me spoil her, send me a message through the email form on this
              sight, and I'll
              tell you the best way to
              <ul>
                <li>Donate a toy, some special treats, or some cat furniture</li>
                <li>Donate money to buy gifts, or a link to her Amazon wishlist of cat entertainment</li>
                <li>Donate money to help pay for vet bills or food and cat litter</li>
              </ul>

            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>For this site, I have curated my long list of jobs I've had to provide
              details only on those that show relevance to my professional and academic
              goals. However, I have been working since I was 15, full-time since I 
              was 18, and the collective experience of fighting uphill to support 
              myself and pursue higher education has given me more perspective and 
              a wider range of soft skills than this list might shine a light on.

              <h4>TCSS - CS333 Intro to Operating Systems</h4>
              <p>
                This is my current job. In this capacity I help undergraduates to understand the 
                material they need for CS333, and help them to debug and problem solve with their
                homework projects.

              <h3>HP Inc</h3>
              <h4>Firmware Engineering Intern - MECOP</h4>
              <p>
                At HP Inc. I developed an end to end solution for the MSB R&D team to 
                use for memory management on their ULE LaserJet products. The feature I developed 
                simplified the process of managing tables in memory and reduced the codesize
                of the ULE product's firmware, which operates in a very constrained memory-environment.
                In addition, the feature enabled a vital security process to run on the ULE products.

              <h4>TCSS - CS162, CS163, and CS202</h4>
              <p>
                In this capacity I helped undergraduates to understand basic computing principles
                as well as helping them to learn to use C++ and Java to effectively solve problems.
