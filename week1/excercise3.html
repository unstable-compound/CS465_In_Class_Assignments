          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>My name is Curtis Lewis, I am a software engineer with an
                interest in a wide range of developer roles. I have
                a particular focus on machine learning, but I am happy in 
                almost any capacity where I am tasked with solving problems.
                I am currently a student at 
                Portland State University, where I am expected to 
                graduate this Spring (2020). 
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time I enjoy gardening, especially growing fresh produce to cook with. I also 
            spend a lot of my free time trying to learn new things, sometimes for my chosen profession to 
            keep myself sharp, and sometimes in an effort to learn outside of my field and broaden my 
            understanding of the world around me. 
          </p>
          <h3>My Cat - Bella</h3>
          <p>
            When I have time to relax at home, I often take my cat Bella outside to play and explore. She is a sweet Tuxedo cat that
            I adopted in 2018. She is 4 years old, (as of Oct 2019), and has had a hard life, which is why I spoil her. She was abused
            in her first home where she lived for almost three years, but now she is coming out of her shell and has love for anyone 
            patient enough to earn it! If you want to help me spoil her, send me a message through the email form on this sight, and I'll 
            tell you the best way to 
            <ul>
              <li>Donate a toy, some special treats, or some cat furniture</li>
              <li>Donate money to buy gifts, or a link to her Amazon wishlist of cat entertainment</li>
              <li>Donate money to help pay for vet bills or food and cat litter</li>
            </ul>

            described as a tuxedo cat because of the black and white markings" title="Curtis' cat Bella, snooping in the grass."
